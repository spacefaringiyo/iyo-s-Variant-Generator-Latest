# iyo's Variant Generator 0.7

A user-friendly desktop application for quickly and easily creating multiple variants of KovaaK's scenario files. This tool is for scenario creators who want to generate different difficulty levels (e.g., smaller/larger targets, faster/slower bots) without manually editing `.sce` files.

## Features

-   **Load Existing Scenarios:** Browse and load any `.sce` scenario file.
-   **Batch Variant Creation:** Generate dozens of variants in a single click.
-   **Intelligent Bot Modifiers:**
    -   **Size:** Modifies the bot's `MainBBRadius` for precise size changes.
    -   **Speed:** Modifies the bot's `MaxSpeed` and `MaxCrouchSpeed` values.
    -   Handles scenarios with single or multiple bot profiles automatically.
-   **Timescale & Duration:** Easily create variants with different game speeds and challenge lengths.
-   **Smart Score Scaling:** Automatically adjusts scoring for duration variants to maintain score-per-minute integrity.
-   **Persistent Settings:** Remembers your folder path, custom values, and checkbox states between sessions via a `settings.json` file.
-   **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and simple UI built with Tkinter for maximum compatibility.
